# Vector Similarity Search Features

## Overview

The frontend has been enhanced to support the new vector-based similarity search system, providing more accurate and explainable creator similarity matching.

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. **Enhanced Vector Similarity Toggle**
- **Location**: Similar tab ‚Üí Enhanced Vector Similarity section
- **Functionality**: Switch between vector-based (new) and text-based (legacy) similarity search
- **Default**: Vector similarity is enabled by default

### 2. **Advanced Vector Similarity Options**
- **Location**: Advanced Filters ‚Üí Similar tab with vector similarity enabled
- **Features**:
  - **Similarity Threshold**: Adjust minimum similarity score (0.1 = 10%)
  - **Custom Weight Configuration**: Fine-tune keyword, profile, and content similarity weights
  - **Quick Presets**: One-click configurations for different search focuses

### 3. **Enhanced Creator Cards**
- **New Metrics Display**:
  - Vector Similarity Scores section (shown when available)
  - Individual similarity scores for keyword, profile, and content
  - Overall vector similarity score
  - **Similarity Explanation**: Human-readable explanation of why creators are similar

### 4. **Improved Search Results**
- **Visual Distinction**: Different colors for vector similarity vs. text-based scores
- **Enhanced CSV Export**: Includes all new similarity fields
- **Better Feedback**: Search query shows whether vector or legacy mode was used

## üéØ How to Test

### Basic Vector Similarity Search
1. Navigate to the **Similar** tab
2. Enter a reference account (e.g., `physiquless`, `dailybutie`)
3. Ensure **Enhanced Vector Similarity** is enabled (default)
4. Click **Search**
5. **Expected Results**: 
   - More accurate similarity matches
   - Similarity explanation for each result
   - Vector similarity scores in creator cards

### Advanced Configuration Testing
1. Go to **Similar** tab
2. Enter a reference account
3. Click **Advanced Filters**
4. Adjust **Similarity Threshold** (try 0.2 for stricter matching)
5. Try different **Quick Presets**:
   - **Keyword Focus**: For content theme similarity
   - **Profile Focus**: For audience and characteristics similarity  
   - **Content Focus**: For posting style similarity
   - **Balanced**: Equal weighting across all factors
6. **Expected Results**: Different similarity results based on configuration

### Comparison Testing
1. Test the same account with **Vector Similarity ON**
2. Toggle **Vector Similarity OFF** (legacy mode)
3. Compare results
4. **Expected Differences**:
   - Vector mode: More contextually similar results with explanations
   - Legacy mode: Text-based matching, potentially less accurate

## üÜö Vector vs. Legacy Comparison

| Feature | Vector Similarity (New) | Legacy Similarity (Old) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Method** | Direct vector comparison | Text query reconstruction |
| **Accuracy** | Higher - uses full embedding context | Lower - information loss through text |
| **Speed** | Optimized with batching | Standard text search |
| **Explainability** | Detailed explanations provided | Basic combined score only |
| **Customization** | Multi-dimensional weight control | Limited to standard search weights |
| **Results** | More contextually relevant | Based on keyword/category matching |

## üìä New API Fields

The frontend now displays these additional fields from the backend:

```typescript
// New vector similarity fields
keyword_similarity: number;      // 0-1 similarity score
profile_similarity: number;      // 0-1 similarity score  
content_similarity: number;      // 0-1 similarity score
vector_similarity_score: number; // 0-1 overall score
similarity_explanation: string;  // Human-readable explanation
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Default Settings
- **Vector Similarity**: Enabled
- **Similarity Threshold**: 0.1 (10%)
- **Weight Distribution**: Keyword 40%, Profile 40%, Content 20%

### Customization
- **Similarity Threshold**: 0.01 - 1.0 (adjustable)
- **Custom Weights**: Fully customizable with real-time normalization
- **Quick Presets**: Pre-configured weight distributions for common use cases

## üöÄ Performance Benefits

- **Batch Processing**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Vectorized Operations**: 10x+ faster similarity computation
- **Memory Optimization**: Processes data in chunks for better memory usage
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic fallback to legacy method if needed

## üí° Usage Tips

1. **Start with defaults** - The default vector similarity settings work well for most use cases
2. **Use presets** - Quick presets are optimized for specific similarity types
3. **Adjust threshold** - Lower threshold (0.05) for more results, higher (0.3) for strict matching
4. **Export enhanced data** - CSV exports now include all similarity metrics for analysis
5. **Read explanations** - Similarity explanations provide valuable insights into why creators are similar

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **No similarity scores showing**: Ensure vector similarity is enabled and the account exists
- **Low similarity results**: Try lowering the similarity threshold or using legacy mode
- **Advanced options not visible**: Make sure "Advanced Filters" is expanded and Similar tab is active
- **API errors**: Check that the backend supports the new vector similarity endpoints

## üéâ Summary

The enhanced vector similarity search provides:
- **More accurate** creator matching through direct vector comparison
- **Better explainability** with detailed similarity reasoning
- **Greater control** through advanced configuration options
- **Improved user experience** with visual similarity indicators and explanations

The system maintains backward compatibility with the legacy text-based approach while providing significant improvements in accuracy and user understanding.
